# Joint Mitigation of Quantum Gate and Measurement Errors via the Z-mixed-state Expression of the Pauli Channel
Hello everyone, <br> <br>
I am Hangming Zhang, one of the authors of the paper "Joint Mitigation of Quantum Gate and Measurement Errors via the Z-mixed-state Expression of the Pauli Channel." I am pleased to share the related code from our paper here. The files qemzmsepc.py, test.ipynb, and qml-task-test.ipynb contain the pre-publication code. These files were written for personal experimental validation and may not be optimized for practical use. <br> <br>
After the paper was published, I developed a V2 version of the code, which is more user-friendly and practical. I will continue to update and optimize this version. If you have any valuable suggestions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Thank you. <br> <br>
In the qemzmsepc.py file, we encapsulated the QEMZMSEPC method into a library. <br> <br>
In the qml-task-test file and test file, we demonstrate two processes of using the QEMZMSEPC method, respectively. <br> <br>
