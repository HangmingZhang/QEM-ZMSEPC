# Joint Mitigation of Quantum Gate and Measurement Errors via the Z-mixed-state Expression of the Pauli Channel
In the qemzmsepc.py file, we encapsulated the QEMZMSEPC method into a library. <br> <br>
In the qml-task-test file and test file, we demonstrate two processes of using the QEMZMSEPC method, respectively. <br> <br>
